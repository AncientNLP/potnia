mappings:
  a: "𐤠"  # Sound: [a]
  b: "𐤡"  # New transliteration p; Sound: [p~b] – plain labial voiced to [b] before nasals and probably [r]
  g: "𐤢"  # Sound: [ɡ]; occasionally substituted for secondarily voiced /k/
  d: "𐤣"  # Sound: [θ~ð]? – descends from PIE *d/*dʰ, lenited PIE *t, and PIE *i̯; likely interdental
  e: "𐤤"  # Sound: [eː] – fairly high and long (like Greek ει), only occurs accented
  v: "𐤥"  # New transliteration w; Sound: [w~v] – descends from PIE *w; may have been labiodental; transcribed as w to avoid confusion with ν
  i: "𐤦"  # Sound: [i]
  y: "𐤧"  # Sound: [i̯~j]? – possibly an allophone of /i/ (attested only 11 times, maybe a Carian borrowing)
  k: "𐤨"  # Sound: [k~ɡ] – voiced to [ɡ] before nasals and probably [r]
  l: "𐤩"  # Sound: [l]
  m: "𐤪"  # Sound: [m]
  n: "𐤫"  # Sound: [n]
  o: "𐤬"  # Sound: [oː] – like Greek ου; only occurs accented
  r: "𐤭"  # Sound: [r]
  ś: "𐤮"  # New transliteration; Sound: [s] – a simple [s] despite its former transcription
  t: "𐤯"  # Sound: [t~d] – voiced to [d] before nasals and probably [r]
  u: "𐤰"  # Sound: [u]
  f: "𐤱"  # Sound: [f] or [ɸ] – labiodental or bilabial fricative; alternates with /w/ in “lews~lefs” (“Zeus”)
  q: "𐤲"  # Sound: [kʷ] – historically [kʷ], though its current pronunciation is unclear
  s: "𐤳"  # New transliteration š; Sound: [ʃ] or [ç] – palatalized *s; newer transcriptions use š
  τ: "𐤴"  # Transliteration given as “τ”; Sound: [tʃ] or [tç] – derived from 𐤯+𐤳 (t+š) as in “kat+šadmẽs > kaττadmẽs”
  ã: "𐤵"  # Nasal vowel, perhaps [ãː] – only occurs accented; appears before nasal consonants
  ẽ: "𐤶"  # Nasal vowel – not [ẽ], perhaps [ã] or [æ̃] as in Lycian; only occurs accented
  λ: "𐤷"  # Sound: [ʎ] (or [ɾʲ]?) – palatalized *l (or possibly a palatalized flap)
  ν: "𐤸"  # New transliteration ñ; Sound: [ɲ] or [ŋ]? – arose from word-final/palatalized *m/*n; re-transliterated as ñ to avoid confusion
  c: "𐤹"  # Sound: [ts~dz]? – an undetermined affricate or fricative (possibly [ts], [z], [dz], or [dʒ])
  "=": '' # This is used as a morpheme boundary
