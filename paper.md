# Summary

Potnia is an open-source Python library designed to convert Romanized transliterations of ancient texts into their respective Unicode representations. The increasing digitization of ancient language corpora has led to significant progress in fields such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), textual restoration, and palaeographic analysis. However, many of these datasets are still presented in Romanized transliteration rather than their original script in Unicode, despite the availability of Unicode blocks for numerous ancient scripts. This discrepancy presents challenges for accurate linguistic representation and computational analysis.

Potnia addresses this gap by providing a flexible, extensible framework for converting transliterated texts to Unicode. The library's initial release supports Linear B texts, with plans to expand functionality to other ancient languages, including Linear A, Sumerian, and Akkadian. By facilitating the conversion of digitized transliterated corpora into Unicode, Potnia enables more accurate tokenization for downstream tasks such as machine learning-based textual analysis, enhancing the capabilities of digital humanities and computational linguistics in the study of ancient languages.

# Statement of need

The application of machine learning to the study of ancient scripts has grown significantly in recent years, emphasizing the need for datasets represented in their original scripts rather than Romanized transliterations. While the Unicode Standard provides the means to encode most ancient scripts, a substantial portion of data continues to be distributed as transliterations due to legacy digitization practices.

Machine learning algorithms, particularly those focused on natural language processing, perform better when working with the original script rather than a Romanized equivalent. Tokenization in Unicode avoids the loss of linguistic nuance and reduces the biases introduced by transliteration. This is crucial in tasks like Optical Character Recognition, decipherment, and representation learning, where the form of the original script can significantly impact the quality of the model.

Potnia fills a critical gap in the existing software ecosystem by providing a specialized tool for converting Romanized transliterations of ancient texts into Unicode. While general-purpose transliteration tools exist, they often lack the specific handling required for ancient scripts, including dealing with uncertain readings, missing elements, and script-specific notations. Potnia's focus on ancient languages and its extensible architecture make it a valuable asset for researchers working with digitized ancient corpora, enabling more accurate and nuanced computational analysis of these texts.

# Implementation

Potnia is implemented in Python with an extensible architecture centered around the Mapper class, which converts transliterated texts into Unicode representations. The library is available on PyPI and is designed to handle the complexities of ancient scripts through a flexible and customizable framework.

## Key Features

1. **YAML-Based Data Storage:**  Potnia stores script-specific syllabograms and logograms in YAML files, allowing easy updates and additions. This approach ensures scalability when integrating new scripts like Linear A and Akkadian.

    ```yaml
    syllabograms:
      ko: êÄí
      no: êÄú
      so: êÄ∞
    ```

2. **Regular Expressions for Complex Text:** Regular expressions are used to manage uncertain readings, special symbols, and compound tokens. This enables accurate tokenization and conversion of transliterated texts.

3. **Custom Tokenization and Unicode Conversion:** Potnia provides a flexible tokenization system tailored to each script‚Äôs unique structure. The to_unicode method converts transliterations into Unicode based on mappings stored in YAML files.

4. **Regularisation of Text:** The regularize method cleans the output by handling missing elements and unnecessary tags, refining the text for downstream use.

    ```python
    # Tokenisation Example
    text = "ko-no-so"
    tokens = linear_b_mapper.tokenize_transliteration(text)
    print(tokens)  # Output: ['ko', '-', 'no', '-', 'so']

    # Unicode Mapping
    from potnia import linear_b_mapper
    text = "ko-no-so"
    unicode_text = linear_b_mapper(text, regularize=True)
    print(unicode_text)  # Output: êÄíêÄúêÄ∞
    ```
5. **Comprehensive Testing:** A test suite validates the accuracy of tokenization and conversion. Test cases, defined in YAML files, cover various scripts like Linear B and Linear A, ensuring reliability and facilitating contributions.

    ```python
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input,expected", expected("linear_b_unicode_regularized"))
    def test_linear_b_unicode_regularized(test_input, expected):
        result = linear_b_mapper(test_input, regularize=True)
        assert result == expected
    ```
This design makes Potnia easily extendable, with Linear B fully supported and work underway for other scripts like Linear A and Akkadian.

# Research Application

Potnia‚Äôs design and functionality address the following challenges in the analysis of ancient texts:

1. **Extensibility:** Potnia is designed to be highly extensible, allowing researchers to integrate new scripts by defining script-specific rules for tokenization and conversion. This flexibility makes the library suitable for a wide range of ancient languages that are not yet represented in Unicode, providing a valuable tool for researchers across various fields of ancient studies.

2. **Integration with Research Workflows:** Researchers can easily incorporate Potnia into their existing workflows. For example, in a typical research scenario, Potnia could be used to preprocess a corpus of Linear B texts before feeding them into a machine learning model for further analysis:

```python
from potnia import linear_b_mapper
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Load corpus
corpus = pd.read_csv('linear_b_corpus.csv')

# Convert transliterations to Unicode
corpus['unicode_text'] = corpus['transliterated_text'].apply(lambda x: linear_b_mapper(x, regularize=True))

# Perform further analysis (e.g., bag-of-words representation)
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
bow_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus['unicode_text'])

# Continue with machine learning tasks...
```

As an example, Potnia‚Äôs functionality is being used as part of a larger project aimed at deciphering Linear A. We are using Potnia to convert Roman transliterations of Linear B tablets into datasets and extend this capability to Linear A. The resulting datasets will be used to train language-specific models for tasks such as text generation and masked language modeling. Future models developed using this library will be released for public use, supporting downstream tasks such as decipherment, textual restoration, and palaeographic analysis.
